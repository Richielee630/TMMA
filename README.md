# TMMA: A Tiled Matrix Multiplication Accelerator for Self-Attention Projections in Transformer Models

## Optimized for Edge Deployment on Xilinx KV260

## ðŸ”¬ Ongoing Research & Work in Progress
This project is an active research effort, and the implementation is currently under development. We plan to open-source the full code once our research paper is published. Some components may be incomplete or restricted for now.

If you're interested in this project, feel free to watch this repository for updates or reach out for discussions. ðŸš€

### Overview
TMMA is an FPGA-based accelerator designed to efficiently execute dense matrix multiplication operations, with a primary focus on accelerating the self-attention projection computations in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). Although our initial goal was to accelerate full DistilBERT inference, development timeline and resource constraints led us to concentrate on optimizing the projection computations (i.e., the matrix multiplications underlying the Q, K, and V projections) in the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA) module.

Optimized for resource-constrained edge devices such as the Xilinx KV260 Vision AI Starter Kit, TMMA leverages efficient dataflow, pipelining, and fixed-point arithmetic to achieve a balanced trade-off between resource utilization, latency, and throughput. This makes it a compelling alternative to conventional CPU and GPU-based inference for critical matrix operations.

## Key Features
- **Accelerated Self-Attention Projections**: Optimizes the matrix multiplications critical to the Q, K, and V projections in Transformer models.
- **Edge-Friendly Deployment**: Specifically designed for resource-constrained FPGAs like the Xilinx KV260, enabling on-device inference.
- **Efficient Memory Utilization**: Minimizes external DRAM access by maximizing on-chip BRAM usage through tiling and data reuse strategies.
- **Vivado HLS-Based Implementation**: Developed using high-level synthesis (HLS) for rapid prototyping and iterative design optimizations.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Demonstrates significant energy savings compared to CPU-based implementations, making it suitable for power-constrained applications.

## Setup and Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TMMA.git
cd TMMA
```
1. Follow the instructions in the `hls/` directory to build the accelerator using Vivado HLS.
2. For FPGA deployment, refer to the example notebooks in the `pynq/` directory.

## Benchmarking
Detailed benchmarking scripts and performance evaluations are provided in the `models/` and `pynq/` directories. Our benchmarks include:
- **Standalone GEMM**: Performance evaluation on random matrices.
- **DistilBERT Attention Throughput**: Inference performance when offloading self-attention projection computations to the FPGA.
